TITLE:
WAVE_NFCENS_v1.2.0 - Combined EMC(GEFSv12.0)-FNMOC wave statistics.

SUMMARY:
- wave_nfcensv1.2.0 reads and processes the  wave files for every forecast
   time output for 21 members coming from GEFSv12 and 20 members 
  coming from FNMOC-waves.
- Interpolates both wave datasets from GEFSv12  (0.25x0.25 deg) and 
  from FNMOC (0.5x0.5 deg) to 1x1 deg resolution.
-Produces files in nawips format using gempak 

CHANGE REQUEST CLASS:

NEW FEATURE:
-Interpolating the input 0.25 deg GEFSv12 input and 0.5 deg FNMOC input
 to 1 deg output.
-Added WMO05 tables, needed for FNMOC wave data.

STRUCTURE AND RESOURCE DESCRIPTION
-Due to the higher resolution wave data from both sources (EMC and FNMOC)
  the computational time has been increased from 13 min to 23 min wallclock time.
-The final output from this system remains the same as the final  products of the
  system in operations.

CHANGES TO SCRIPTS AND CODES:
-In scripts/exwave_nfcens.sh
  Added lines to interpolate FNMOC-waves data from 0.5x0.5 deg to 1x1 deg.
  Changed lines to interpolate EMC-wave data from 0.25x0.25 deg to 1x1 deg.
-Added two tables gempak/fix/g2varswmo5.tbl and gempak/fix/g2vcrdwmo5.tbl
  (FNMOC fields need updated WMO5 header tables)

UPSTREAM DEPENDENCIES:
- GEFSV12.0
- FNMOC, data at 
    /gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/dcom/prod/20200518/wgrbbul/fnmoc_ocn_ens_0p5_gb2

DISSEMINATION INFO
N/A

BUGFIXES:

BENEFIT OF CHANGE:
- Allows the  use of higher resolution input, from both upstream data sources
  (EMC and  FNMOC) which will provide  products with higher quality. 
- Allows the use of the GEFSv12 output, separated files for every forecast time.
- It keeps the same output data volume

USER IMPACT STATEMENT:
-Despite the changes in geographical resolution on both databases (EMC and FNMOC)
  the size of the final products remains the same as they keep the same resolution as 
  in  operations, however the quality of the final product have been enhanced by the 
 increase in resolution on both databases.  

TECHNICAL IMPACT STATEMENT:
N/A

RISKS:
N/A

UPDATES:

TESTING:
Dev testing completed.

RISKS:
N/A

TECHNICAL DETAILS OF REQUIRED SYSTEM USAGE:
 All the items are exactly  the same as in the system in operations, except the RUNTIME,
 As the new NFCENS version uses higher resolution input data and it needs more
 to interpolate those data to a 1x1 deg wave fields. 
- Runtime: 23 min
- Consumable Memory: mem=2500
- Disk Storage: 623 M
- Node: 1
- Serial
- Shared job

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
-To build the executable needed for this system, run sorc/build_nfcens.sh, 
  this will create exec/nfcombwave_ensemble
