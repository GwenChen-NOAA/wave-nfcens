List of all code/scripts modified with this release

1. Versions directory added 

2. sorc:
   build_nfcens.sh
   sorc/nfcombwave_ensemble.fd: 
   makefile

3. scripts
   exwave_nfcens.sh
   exnawips_nfcens.sh

4. jobs

   jwave_nfcens_gempak.ecf

6. dev 
   directory is a temperary directory where modified jobs and ecf are for testing;
   in dev  mode 


1. Added a new directory :
versions :
build.ver
run.ver 

2.Under sorc directory: 
build_nfcens.sh: is modified to use build.ver from versions directory and removed

OMP_NUM_THREADS to make it run faster
JWAVE_NFCENS_GEMPAK:Added PBS and removed BSUB; added versions file (run.ver); added modules

6. dev: Where the development ecf and jobs are for it to run in dev mode

What changes were made to the above code/scripts to support the new architecture?
EE2 standards, use of build.ver and run.ver, removing .ecf extension from scripts directory

Tasks per node:1
Serial or parallel or mpmd: serial
Memory requirements (exclusive or shared): shared
List any other PBS resource information requirements or MPI tunables
need to include 
export export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 to make "wgrib2" run faster
